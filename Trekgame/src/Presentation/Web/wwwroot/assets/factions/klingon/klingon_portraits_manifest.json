Realistic skin texture with a non-glossy, soft clay finish. High-end stop-motion animation quality (Laika/Aardman style).\nProportions (Crucial): Stylized but near-realistic proportions. Do NOT use excessive caricature or oversized head.\nLighting: Soft, cinematic studio lighting that emphasizes the clay texture (subsurface scattering).
